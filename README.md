This installation guide assumes you already have npm/Node installed in your machine. Run below instructions on the terminal.

###Install Server dependencies: 
```javascript
cd Parser/server && npm i
```
###Start server
```javascript
npm run dev
```

###Install client dependencies: 
```javascript
cd ../client && npm i
```
###Start client project
```javascript

The project is currently very much geared to running locally on the machine but if hosted then the URLs on the client side can be changed or Axios can be used then a proxy can be added to client side package.json.
